Project_0.4 - Lasercut mechanism
==========================

Final project idea: laser cut mechanism(especially linkage mechanism), I'm trying to make a few mechanisms, especially linkage mechanisms that moves in different way, for example Theo Janssen beast mechanism, human bones(cycling), scissor linkage, photo iris...etc. ,which will end up with a kinetic installation.  Actually, I already started to work on this and now am at the stage of finishing. I'll upload my pictures and the process of making as soon as possible.
