# Proposal: Digital Fabrication Studio -­ A custom midi controller

### Overview: 
The concept is of a module that helps to trigger and scan between 9 different
scenarios using either 9 buttons or a single controller object such as a knob. The device
helps to send 9 different midi trigger data to the computer or some other device. I would
like to build an artefact/module that combines the digital fabrication with basic electronics. The
reason why it is 9 is because I am isolating 9 archetypes based on Indian concept of Rasa or
‘essence’ of emotions.

### Module Design:
The module, somewhat shaped as ‘ufo-­like’ (form is open to change) will have enough space
within to hold a circuit board or arduino (however this can also be external). It should be robust
and keep the buttons in place. It is just a triggering device so there is no complication within it,
unless I design it to ‘clamp’ to a projector or computer. The ‘clamp’ might then be a separate
part.

### Fabrication tools: Laser cutter to build the ‘module’. Perhaps can also be CnC?
Use: The 9 triggers and the module are somewhat an extension of my thesis work based on
developing some scenario building tools for organizational reflection that might combine another
work I have been doing in India with archetypes and music in India.


### Function:
1. The module has to look usable and inviting.
2. Each of the nine switches sends a MIDI on/off, toggle data to the computer.
3. These nine midi signals can trigger anything you like. However I would like for
it to be able to switch between 9 images of a slide projector or at least computer.
4. Alternatively, the triggers can trigger 9 modes of music etc. as well. Or just
about anything.


I have a sketch of the box that I can try scan in today.
