Proposal: Digital Fabrication Studio - An electronic piggy bank based on a fun character
==========================

Overview: The concept is of a jukebox module which looks like a robotic character. It can be hung on the wall like a mask. The user can put in coins through its mouth. Once a coin is dropped, it is collected within a box inside that is not seen outside. 

Optional electronics:
If electronics are added, then it might be able to trigger the eyes of the robot jukebox to flash. POssibly, trigger short 5 second sound loops as well.

However, I would like to focus on just creating the artefact now and not the electronics.

 

Design: Unlike traditional piggy banks, this one is built of the face alone. Behind the face is the necessary depth needed to create enough thickness to have a cavity within.
The character will be lazer cut from several layers of MDF, so that the it adds enough depth within the cavity for the coins.
The top layer will have the 'face' of the character engraved with the lazer cutter with a more interesting transluscent material such as plexiglass / acrylic material.


Fabrication tools: Lazer cutter.

Character: Will be converted to vector using illustration.

Learning in course: 

I am interested in making 'custom' housing modules for electronics, and this is one way to rethink how boxes are designed (instead of square, having layers of mdf or so cut from top down in a certain shape..)

The character draws people as a strange yet familiar object and mysteriously playful. I want to learn how to 
cut and engrave using some variation of materials and make at least one 


Softwares: Rhino or some 3d software for making layers of the 'mask', and illustrator for the vectors?
