I'm still not sure about the exercise. I wanted to use the CNC or Milling or both because most of people doesn't. Basically I'd like to make something that could be done in laser cutting and milling. First thing I thought about was engraving a 3D 

Idea1 - Fading Face
I have an old project together with another student where we scanned both of our heads and she helped me with the 3D, the idea is to deform the heads until they mix and become a organic shaped human face form but still somehow irrecognizable. I'd like to make it big like 60 cm, with 10-15 depth, the idea of doing it in the CNC is exploring the capabilities of the drill as much as possible.

Idea2 - Photo engraving
As a photographer I'd also like to use the cutting/engraving machines to reproduce photography in a different media. The example here would be from a photography print (A3) choose a color, for example white if it's a black and white photography and vectorize the white areas and from the cut space have a new image according to the background color, so for example an idea of exhibition would be having 5 variations of the photo, painting the background in five different colors, each image would be the same but have a different look.

Idea3 - Glitch
I'd like to use the milling/cnc together with 3d print, making the 3D a 'second layer' and color. So for example I'd engrave an image and them sbstitute the board of the 3D printer to print the 3d as a second layer, the 3D would be like a 2D image (so big lines and one or two layers depth instead of actually building something), another addition would be printing image glitchs on the milled surface and glue them to add some more color.


Idea4 - Bussiness Card
One other option that would be easier is doing my bussiness card, something that I already wanted to do for the laser cut exercise. It's basically my logo and name cut with in paper with the laser cutter, challenges would be the thickness of the paper and the relation between the thickness and the burning effect. I would like to see as less burn as possible, the idea of having a laser cut card is that with the empty spaces (the laser cut one) the card would be the color of the surface background which appeals to the idea of 'visual artist'.
